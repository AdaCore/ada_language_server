# gitpod.io integration

> [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open source platform for
> automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends into
> your existing workflow. It enables developers to describe their dev
> environment as code and start instant and fresh development environments
> for each new task directly from your browser.

In a gidpod session you can:

* navigate and edit the LSP Server sources
* commit changes and send pull requests
* collaborate and share the workspace
  (See https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration/)
* build and check compiler diagnostics using `/Terminal/Run Build Task...`
  menu
* start debugger with `/Debug/Start Debugging` menu (or `F5`)

The editor has a lot of commands built in. Press `F1` to search a command.

By default the editor is configured for the `gnat/lsp_server.gpr` project.
You can switch the project by changing `/File/Settings/Open Preferences` or
`Ctrl+,`, see Ada section.
