## 24.0.1 (2023-10-20)

This is the first release using the LSP 3.17 protocol.
We utilized the JSON metamodel to generate message types
and interfaces for working with them. Due to significant
changes in many types, a large portion of the code was
rewritten. Although all our tests pass, it is possible
that some errors have not yet been discovered.
Nevertheless, the new protocol will enable us to
implement even more new features for Ada in the future.

  * Add initialization code that checks specific combinations of
     architectures and platforms (e.g. arm64-darwin is supported even
     though it actually uses the x64-darwin executable, will use x86_64
     target by default however)
  * But no native ALS for `arm64` is provided for now
* Accept task bodies and packages for [subprogram box command](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/issues/1153)
