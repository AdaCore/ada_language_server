## Configuration and Logs

Please provide your VS Code workspace-specific configuration files and logs. Logs are in particular very useful to investigate bugs such as unexpected exceptions.

- `tasks.json` file (for VS Code task-related issues) or `launch.json` (for VS Code debug-related issues)
- Logs from running `Ada: Show extension output` from the VS Code command palette
- Logs from the Ada Language Server in the  `$HOME/.als directory` (`%USERPROFILE%/.als` on Windows). More info about ALS logging can be found [here](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/blob/master/doc/traces.md)
