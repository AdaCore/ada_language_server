# Configure the extension

☝ Make sure to configure the active `*.gpr` project file, otherwise
the extension will use the first project file found in the root project
folder.

⚙ You can change settings per workspace or per user: generally we recommend to
change the project file setting in the desired workspace, since project files
are usually workspace-specific.
