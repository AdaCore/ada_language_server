A GPR project file allows you to specify the directories containing your source files, the compilation options used to build your project and many more aspects of your project's lifecycle.

If you don't already have a project file, click the button on the left to get started with a Hello World example!

If you only have one `.gpr` file at the root of your workspace, the Ada & SPARK extension will automatically use it.
However we recommend configuring the main project file explicitly in the workspace setting [ada.projectFile](command:toSide:workbench.action.openWorkspaceSettings?%22ada.projectFile%22).
