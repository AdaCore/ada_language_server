Several VS Code tasks are provided to work with Ada & SPARK projects.
You can find them by using the [`Tasks: Run Task`](command:workbench.action.tasks.runTask) command and selecting the `ada` or `spark` task groups.

Use the [`ada: Build current project`](command:workbench.action.tasks.runTask?%22ada%3A%20Build%20current%20project%22) task to build your project.

If you would like to customize a task, for example by providing additional command line arguments, you can use the gear icon on the right-hand side of a task and edit it in your workspace's `tasks.json` file.
