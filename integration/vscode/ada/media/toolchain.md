Ada and SPARK are compiled languages which means that a compiler is needed to translate the source code into a program that can be executed.

We recommend installing the GNAT compiler for Ada from [these channels](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/tree/master/integration/vscode/ada#getting-additional-tools) and [configuring it in your environment](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/tree/master/integration/vscode/ada#environment-setup).
