This extension provides support for the Ada and SPARK programming languages in VS Code via the [Ada Language Server](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server) based on the [Libadalang library](https://github.com/AdaCore/libadalang).

## Features

Ada and SPARK are compiled languages which means that a compiler (GNAT) is needed to translate the source code into a program that can be executed.
Other tools are also needed to perform tasks such as testing, static analysis and formal proof of SPARK code.

This extension **does not include a compiler nor additional tools**. Nonetheless it offers a number of features out of the box and more capabilities can be accessed by installing additional tools.

## Getting Additional Tools

For a fully operational development environment you can obtain a compiler and/or other tools from the following channels.

### AdaCore Customers

If you are an [AdaCore](https://www.adacore.com/) customer, log into your account on [GNAT Tracker](https://support.adacore.com/csm) to download the tools available in your subscription.

### Community Users

The Ada & SPARK tools are available to the community through different channels:

* [ALIRE](https://alire.ada.dev/): The Ada LIbrary Repository provides the means to install compiler [toolchains](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#toolchain-management).
The `gnatprove` crate provides GNATprove.
Both tools are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (Intel and Apple silicon)
* On Windows with [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) you can install the `gcc` and `gprbuild` packages.
