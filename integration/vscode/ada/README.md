This extension provides support for the Ada and SPARK programming languages in VS Code via the [Ada Language Server](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server) based on the [Libadalang library](https://github.com/AdaCore/libadalang).

## Features

Ada and SPARK are compiled languages which means that a compiler (GNAT) is needed to translate the source code into a program that can be executed.
Other tools are also needed to perform tasks such as testing, static analysis and formal proof of SPARK code.

This extension **does not include a compiler nor additional tools**. Nonetheless it offers a number of features out of the box and more capabilities can be accessed by installing additional tools.

## Getting Additional Tools

For a fully operational development environment you can obtain a compiler and/or other tools from the following channels.

### AdaCore Customers

If you are an [AdaCore](https://www.adacore.com/) customer, log into your account on [GNAT Tracker](https://support.adacore.com/csm) to download the tools available in your subscription.

### Community Users

The Ada & SPARK tools are available to the community through different channels:

* [ALIRE](https://alire.ada.dev/): The Ada LIbrary Repository provides the means to install compiler [toolchains](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#toolchain-management).
The `gnatprove` crate provides GNATprove.
Both tools are available for Linux, Windows and macOS.
* On Linux distributions you can use your package manager to install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) which includes the GNAT Ada compiler.
You also need to install the `gprbuild` package.
* On Windows with [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) you can install the `gcc` and `gprbuild` packages.
* On macOS you can find GCC releases including GNAT for Intel and Apple silicon at [this project on GitHub](https://github.com/simonjwright/distributing-gcc/releases) courtesy of Simon Wright.

## Environment Setup

The following environment variables influence the operation of the Ada extension:

* `PATH` should include the path to the GNAT compiler installation in order to benefit from auto-completion and navigation into the standard runtime.
Without it, auto-completion and navigation will work only on the sources visible in the project closure, but not on the packages of the standard library `Ada.*`.

* `GPR_PROJECT_PATH` provides paths to other `.gpr` Ada projects that your project depends on.

When running VS Code locally, you can provide these environment variables by exporting them in a terminal, and starting VS Code from that same terminal with the `code` command.

## Settings

This extension can be configured with a set of `ada.*` settings documented [here](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server/blob/master/doc/settings.md).

The most prominent one is `ada.projectFile` where you can provide the path to the `.gpr` project file.
If no project is provided and if your workspace contains a single project file at the root, then that one will be automatically used.

## VS Code Remote

The Ada extension can be used on a remote workspace over SSH thanks to the [Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension, however there are known pitfalls regarding the environment setup.

The recommended method for environment setup in a remote configuration is to set the `terminal.integrated.env.*` settings. You can set environment variables through the VS Code Workspace or User setting `terminal.integrated.env.[linux|windows|osx]` depending on your platform.
For example:

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {
    "PATH": "/path/to/my/gnat/installation/bin:${env:PATH}",
    "GPR_PROJECT_PATH": "/path/to/some-lib-1:/path/to/some-lib-2"
  }
}
```

Note that after changing this VS Code setting, the extension will display a popup asking you to reload the current window to take the environment changes into account. You can still run the `Developer: Reload Window` command manually to apply the changes later on.

In addition to Workspace and User settings, the Remote settings file can also be used to set the `terminal.integrated.env.*` settings, with standard precedence rules applying between the different setting scopes.
With this method, changes to the environment can be applied simply with the `Developer: Reload Window` command.

Another method for environment setup is possible.
According to [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_configure-the-environment-for-the-remote-extension-host) the environment of the remote extension host is based on the default shell configuration scripts such as `~/.bashrc` so it is possible to provide your toolchain and project environment setup in your default shell configuration script.
However to make changes to that environment the typical `Developer: Reload Window` command is not enough and it is necessary to fully restart the VS Code server.
To do that you must close all VS Code Remote windows, and kill all VS Code server processes on the server (e.g. `killall node` if no other `node` processes are used on the server).

## macOS and Apple Silicon

On macOS with Apple silicon it is possible to use either the native `aarch64` version of the GNAT compiler or the `x86_64` version running seamlessly with [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).
If you are using the `aarch64` version, as this is still a relatively new platform for Ada tools, it is necessary to set the following attribute in your main project file to obtain navigation and auto-completion functionalities on the standard runtime:

```ada
for Target use "aarch64-darwin";
```

If you encounter issues with the compiler on macOS, it is recommended to consult known issues at Simon Wright's [GitHub project](https://github.com/simonjwright/distributing-gcc/issues) and discussions on the [comp.lang.ada](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.ada) group.
